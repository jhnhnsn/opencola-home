    <h2>What is OpenCola?</h2>
    <p>
        OpenCola enables people to create trust networks. It is designed to be an
        alternative to big tech that puts you in control of your personal data and
        allows you to shape the flow of information around you.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sounds great, but what does OpenCola actually do?</h2>
    
    <p>
        While the technology can support many different types of applications, the first
        one we built is a collaborative media tool that looks a lot like social media
        without the long list of trust issues that current applications have created.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On top of providing you with similar features to many existing social
        applications, OpenCola offers the following benefits:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Local First Data</b>: You decide where your data lives, which by default is
            on your device. And it’s all your data across all sites.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personal Search</b>: Everything you and your peers post is available through
            search.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personal Archive</b>: The things you save get archived so that you can
            access them later, even when offline.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personas</b>: People express themselves differently depending on the
            audience. Existing social media generally ignores this distinction.
            OpenCola provides personas that allow you to express yourself in a more
            authentic fashion because you are in full control of the audience that
            you’re interacting with. You can share with and talk to your friends
            differently than you share with and talk to your family or your work
            colleagues. This means you aren’t forced to communicate to “the lowest
            common denominator” of people you’re connected to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Trusted Connections</b>: With OpenCola, you don’t need to reveal that you exist
            to anyone, except the people you trust and want to interact with. You can
            connect with someone just by exchanging a token using Email, SMS, Chat, etc.
            This means that unless you allow it, there are no bots, scammers, trolls,
            ads, algorithms, or 3rd party intermediary manipulation. For those that want
            to be public, we will support a registration server at a later phase.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Information Centric</b>: Existing social media is designed to maximize personal
            celebrity vs. engaging in shared conversation. If two people share the same
            web link or story, they may never know each other has shared it, and all
            activity accumulates separately. With OpenCola, activity around shared posts
            / links is aggregated, allowing for collaboration to grow around ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>You are the moderator</b>: Information only flows when you make the decision to
            save it, not because an algorithm thinks it will generate activity. You can
            also mark information as untrusted which can be used by your peers as a
            filter or as warning to help your peers navigate unknown information /
            sources.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What do you mean by trust?</h2>
    <p>OpenCola is built to maximize trust in the following dimensions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Transparency</b>: People need to see and understand the motives,
            intentions, and actions of others in order to trust them. This type of
            visibility is essential in empowering people to make informed decisions
            about how to interact with other people, companies or applications.
            Higher transparency leads to higher trust. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Accountability</b>: People need to take responsibility for their actions and
            decisions in order to be trusted, which requires negative consequences for bad
            behavior. Higher accountability  leads to higher trust.
        </li>
        <li><b>Personal Control</b>: People need control over how they interact with each
            other, how they use an application, and how information about them is used.
            Higher personal control leads to higher trust. 
        </li>  
        <li><b>Security</b>: People need assurances that a bad actor can’t pretend to be
            someone they aren’t or access information in an unauthorized manner. Higher
            security leads to higher trust.
        </li>
    </ul>
