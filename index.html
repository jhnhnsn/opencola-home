    <h2>What is OpenCola?</h2>
    <p>
        OpenCola enables people to create trust networks. It is designed to be an
        alternative to big tech that puts you in control of your personal data and
        allows you to shape the flow of information around you.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sounds great, but what does OpenCola actually do?</h2>
    
    <p>
        While the technology can support many different types of applications, the first
        one we built is a collaborative media tool that looks a lot like social media
        without the long list of trust issues that current applications have created.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On top of providing you with similar features to many existing social
        applications, OpenCola offers the following benefits:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Local First Data</b>: You decide where your data lives, which by default is
            on your device. And it’s all your data across all sites.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personal Search</b>: Everything you and your peers post is available through
            search.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personal Archive</b>: The things you save get archived so that you can
            access them later, even when offline.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personas</b>: People express themselves differently depending on the
            audience. Existing social media generally ignores this distinction.
            OpenCola provides personas that allow you to express yourself in a more
            authentic fashion because you are in full control of the audience that
            you’re interacting with. You can share with and talk to your friends
            differently than you share with and talk to your family or your work
            colleagues. This means you aren’t forced to communicate to “the lowest
            common denominator” of people you’re connected to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Trusted Connections</b>: With OpenCola, you don’t need to reveal that you exist
            to anyone, except the people you trust and want to interact with. You can
            connect with someone just by exchanging a token using Email, SMS, Chat, etc.
            This means that unless you allow it, there are no bots, scammers, trolls,
            ads, algorithms, or 3rd party intermediary manipulation. For those that want
            to be public, we will support a registration server at a later phase.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Information Centric</b>: Existing social media is designed to maximize personal
            celebrity vs. engaging in shared conversation. If two people share the same
            web link or story, they may never know each other has shared it, and all
            activity accumulates separately. With OpenCola, activity around shared posts
            / links is aggregated, allowing for collaboration to grow around ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>You are the moderator</b>: Information only flows when you make the decision to
            save it, not because an algorithm thinks it will generate activity. You can
            also mark information as untrusted which can be used by your peers as a
            filter or as warning to help your peers navigate unknown information /
            sources.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What do you mean by trust?</h2>
    <p>OpenCola is built to maximize trust in the following dimensions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Transparency</b>: People need to see and understand the motives,
            intentions, and actions of others in order to trust them. This type of
            visibility is essential in empowering people to make informed decisions
            about how to interact with other people, companies or applications.
            Higher transparency leads to higher trust. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Accountability</b>: People need to take responsibility for their actions and
            decisions in order to be trusted, which requires negative consequences for bad
            behavior. Higher accountability  leads to higher trust.
        </li>
        <li><b>Personal Control</b>: People need control over how they interact with each
            other, how they use an application, and how information about them is used.
            Higher personal control leads to higher trust. 
        </li>  
        <li><b>Security</b>: People need assurances that a bad actor can’t pretend to be
            someone they aren’t or access information in an unauthorized manner. Higher
            security leads to higher trust.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>So why should I trust OpenCola?</h2>
    <p>
        Fair question. We’ve all been burned too many times. Companies have been
        telling us what trust is and that we should just trust them for a long
        time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The above trust principles guide how we operate and what we build. That
        is why we are a non-profit company, our code is open source that you are
        free to modify to best fit your needs, and your data is not visible to
        us. We can never extract the value of your networks or information and
        exploit it for profit, nor can anybody else (unless that’s what you
        want). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In order to make things easy to use, we provide some centralized
        services, but we provide you the means to run everything on your own.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        OpenCola is also free, in the freedom sense - you can take what you
        like, modify it, sell it, and we can never take it away. It will run as
        long as your device operates. 
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We believe that true competition requires competition of incentive
        models. We reject the belief that obscene corporate profit equals
        consumer good and instead are guided by maximizing trust. We aim to be a
        sustainable business by offering value <i>without compromising trust</i>,
        rather than seeking metastasized growth to satisfy investors and
        shareholders. 
    </p>
    <h2>Who is OpenCola for?</h2>
    <p>
        The current collaboration tool is quite general and can be useful to
        anyone, even if it’s used in isolation and never connected to other
        peers. But connecting to peers is quite powerful, as we’ve seen with
        social media and many other types of applications. Here are some other
        application we’re thinking about:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Healthcare</b>: Healthcare consumers have to rely on proprietary
            software to manage transport of healthcare records. This software is
            controlled by companies who have an incentive to lock in lucrative
            contracts in order to maximize profit, which raises healthcare
            costs. Imagine instead having direct control of your healthcare
            records that you can connect with your various healthcare providers.
            Get test results directly from labs that, under your control,
            automatically synchronize with your doctors. When you switch
            doctors, just disconnect your old doctor and connect your new
            doctor. You would get greater flexibility, offered at lower cost,
            because it uses an open, general platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Education</b>: With some simple modifications (e.g. limiting connections to
            classmates), the OpenCola collaboration tool could be useful in a classroom
            setting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Journalism</b>: News outlets have been hurt by social media platforms siphoning
            away audience and ad revenue. OpenCola could allow these organizations to
            interact directly with their audience, restoring hard earned value to the
            organizations. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>User Centric Recommendations</b>: Since OpenCola can store your data across all
            sites, there’s a lot more information that could be used to help you find
            things of interest. Imagine being able to choose a YouTube recommendation,
            built outside of YouTube,  optimized for you that could get you out of
            filter bubbles. Or an Amazon product recommendation system that can’t be
            manipulated by Amazon to maximize profit, that can make use of your
            network’s product ratings instead of those from unknown people on Amazon
            that are gamed by bots.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Creative Markets (Music, Books, YouTubers, etc.)</b>: Creators spend great time
            and effort to build loyal audiences but are at the mercy of corporate
            intermediaries (Amazon, Record Labels, YouTube, etc.) for their success.
            OpenCola could support direct interactions (including sales) between
            creators and their communities, so creators have more control over their
            livelihood.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Open Banking</b>: Your financial information is generally locked in numerous
            proprietary silos, making it hard to get a single picture of your financial
            state. Some products allow you to merge the data from all your financial
            institutions, but they require that you let them see all of this private
            information. OpenCola could be used to model financial transactions and
            allow for applications that let you see your financial data the way you want
            to see it, without having to expose this data to anyone else.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How does OpenCola address issues created by social media?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Information Silos</b>: Big tech <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs">
                wants your data to be locked into their platforms </a> so that
                it’s hard for you to leave. This means that you can’t use your
                data for any purpose other than what companies allow you to do
                with it. With OpenCola, your data lives wherever you choose, on
                your local device by default. You are essentially “always
                migrated”, so there is no switching cost. You can use any
                application on top of your data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Attention Economy</b>: Most big tech companies make money off
                advertising which means they make more money by <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/11/24/sick-of-the-attention-economy-its-time-to-rebel/">keeping
                you trapped in their products</a>. OpenCola does not operate on an
                ad model, nor does it have any incentive to keep you locked in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Privacy abuse</b>: Your personal data and activity is valuable, which is why 
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/11/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-data-brokers">
                    it is often sold, without your knowledge or permission
                </a>, infringing on your
                basic freedoms. With OpenCola, your private data is encrypted and not
                visible to the platform, so your privacy can’t be abused.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Corporate concentration of wealth / power</b>: When corporations get big, 
                <a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876?ln=en">
                    they use their power in ways to suppress competition as well as
                    change their policies in opaque ways that are hard for everyday
                    people to understand
                </a>.
                OpenCola provides an alternative to these products that can counteract this
                abuse of power.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Misinformation</b>: Misinformation is fueled by algorithms
                promoting content that generates activity for the benefit of <a
                href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs">
                ad driven business models</a> as well as 
                <a href="https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/events/scourge-russian-disinformation">
                    parties seeking to manipulate belief
                </a>. Information in the OpenCola network is traceable
                so those spreading bad information can be held to account by being
                cut off, resulting in a loss of influence. In addition, information
                only flows when someone trusts it enough to save it for themself.
                Lastly, information can also be marked as untrusted which helps
                peers avoid it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Polarization</b>: Emotion, especially negative emotion, drives engagement but
                <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/">
                    also drives people apart
                </a>. Since OpenCola is not concerned about engagement, there are no
                algorithms that promote sensational content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stifled Innovation</b>: Big tech focuses on features that
                generate revenue, and often leads to situations like <a
                href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/3/23193650/twitter-blue-android-users-pay-drop-spaces-button">
                having to pay to <i>remove</i> features
            </a>. With
            OpenCola, anybody can modify the application to suit their needs, and
            valuable features that don’t necessarily generate revenue can be offered.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bots</b>: Since big tech companies are centralized, they are
            targets for those that wish to manipulate information flow, for
            profit or for power, <a
            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/12/04/the-social-impact-of-bad-bots-and-what-to-do-about-them/">
            which results in harm to the people using these systems
        </a>. Because OpenCola connections are based on trust, it is not
        practical for bots to impact your network.
